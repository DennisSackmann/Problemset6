# OLS
Minimize the squared sum of all observations.

# Weighted OLS
Same as OLS, but observations are weighted, resulting in some observations beeing more relevant than others.

# Huber
More robust against outliers.
Small errors are trated just like in OLS.
Big errors are treated with absolute error, not squared.

# ElasticNet



# PCR
First Step: PCA
Second Step: PCR
